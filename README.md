## Baikal Voice Tips

There are lotta methods to study english.  
It's recognized that the more you immerse yourself in the environment, the better you begin to understand the 
foreign language and culture.  
So that's a reason why I deceided to use lotta ways to achive this goal.  
The most of these tips are banal, but every tip suggest concrete solution or **several solutions**.
All of these solutions together make a process of daily education.  
It was my goal: build a **process for easy daily education**.

### 1. Use background teaching mode 📲
Wordbit app (or analogues) helps you to do it when you unlock your mobile screen.  
It's the easiest way, and surely that's not efficient. But just imagine how many times you unlock your phone every day,
and think about month or year. This method can support you to study words, it cannot change words studing totally, but
it's very helpful like one of bricks in the wall of your education.

### 2. Study phrases (not only words) 🚀
When we are kids, first we try to say sounds, then we try to say word, then sentence and only then text with bunch of sententes.
When you start studing words with context, for example in sentence.  Your skill starts growing faster than when you study alone words.

### 3. Watch native english teachers 📖
The era of the Internet has come, and there is good opportunity to visit lections from home.  
That's very interesting to listen about grammar or vocabular (especially **phrasal verbs**) not only from your local english teachers
but from native english teachers. They have experience to teach their native language to foreigners.
For that goal i happy to use **EngVid** school Videos and **Luke's English** podcast.

### 4. Use voices messages ✈️
Every year the pace of life is faster and faster.  
There are lotta people around you who wants to study english with you.
But It's difficult to negotiate about time for conversation.  
There is solution: use telegram voices messages.
That's free and you can record it in comfortable time for you and your friend will read it when he will have time 
for it. That's awesome, right?
If your listening skill weak, you can buy telegram premium and you will read messages and then listen to it.  

### 5. Translate messages in you native language into English 🇬🇧
There are ways to translate messages to english in messengers or in phones.  
For example I use telegram premium for it.
