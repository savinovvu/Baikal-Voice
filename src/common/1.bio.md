Hello, My name is Vasiliy. I am a software developer.   
My hobby is **english**, guitar playing, cycling, traveling and .  
I was born in 1989 in a small town Ust-Kut in Russia.  
At school and at university I studied German language and couldn't imagine that I'd speak english in the future.  
Often we cannot study english because we have no enough time, power or money.  
Or maybe the most reasonably because we don't know the method how we can study it with conspicuous technologies.  
I developed my own method how to fix this situation and use all power of technologies.  
It appeared very helpful for me and I would like to share this method with you.  
Hopefully it will be an interesting journey for all of us.
