Hello, My name is Vasiliy. I am a software developer.   
My hobby is **english**, guitar playing, cycling, traveling, walking, hiking, driving.  
I was born in 1989 in a small town Ust-Kut in Russia.  
At school and at university I studied German language and couldn't imagine that I'd speak english in the future.
I told this, because often we cannot study english because we have no enough time, power, money or brave.  
Or in perhaps because we don't know the method how we can study it with contemporary technologies.  
I developed my own education process which based on a mix of different approaches and this allows me to correct
this situation and use all power of technologies.  
It appeared very helpful for me and I would like to share this method with you.  
*Hopefully it will be an interesting journey for all of us.*
