# Conditional clauses

The condition clause usually consists with "if" and expresses a hypothetical situation,  
while the result clause describes what will happen if the condition is met.

###  Short explanation
| Conditional Type | Structure | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Zero Conditional | If + present simple, present simple | If it rains, the ground gets wet. |
| First Conditional | If + present simple, will + infinitive | If I study hard, I will pass the exam. |
| Second Conditional | If + past simple, would + infinitive | If I had more money, I would travel the world. |
| Third Conditional | If + past perfect, would have + past participle | If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam. |

### Zero Conditional Type:

The zero conditional is used for when the time being referred to is **now or always** and the situation is **real and possible**.  
The zero conditional is often used to refer to general truths. The tense in both parts of the sentence is the simple present.  
In zero conditional sentences, the word "if" can usually be replaced by the word "when" without changing the meaning.

### 1 Conditional Type:

The type 1 conditional is used to refer to the **present or future** where **the situation is real**.  
The type 1 conditional refers to a possible condition and its probable result.  
In these sentences the if clause is in the simple present, and the main clause is in the simple future.

### 2 Conditional Type:

The type 2 conditional is used to refer to a time that is **now or any time**, and a situation that is **unreal**.  
These sentences are not based on fact. The type 2 conditional is used to refer to a hypothetical condition and its probable result.  
In type 2 conditional sentences, the if clause uses the simple past, and the main clause uses the present conditional.

### 3 Conditional Type:

The type 3 conditional is used to refer to a time that is **in the past**, and a situation that is **contrary to reality**.  
The facts they are based on are the opposite of what is expressed.  
The type 3 conditional is used to refer to an unreal past condition and its probable past result.  
In type 3 conditional sentences, the if clause uses the past perfect, and the main clause uses the perfect conditional.
