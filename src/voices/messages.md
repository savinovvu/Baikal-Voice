ðŸ‘¥ Guys, for those who want to speak more fluently, I have a special group! It's essentially just a list of people who want to send and receive voice messages. ðŸŽ¤

ðŸ’¬ You can add yourself to the group, choose a partner, and send them a voice message. This doesn't replace or cancel the group, but complements it. In my experience, it's best to work with voice messages in pairs rather than in a group.

ðŸ‘‚ Voice messages have many benefits:
1. You can re-listen and re-record before sending.
2. You can listen to them several times when you receive them.
3. Don't be shy to ask your partner to write down unclear moments of their conversation. Then, listen to the recording one more time after they have written it down. Usually, it becomes clear and even funny.
4. Speech and listening practice will help you develop your skills. ðŸš€
